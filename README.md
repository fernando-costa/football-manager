## What is it

Full Stack project developed as a challenge for completing the Back-End module at Trybe Web Development course.

It aims to integrate a dockerized Back-End Express HTTP server written in TypeScript as a RESTful API by use of Sequelize to a React based dockerized Front-End. Tested using Puppeteer, Jest, Mocha and Sinon and is orchestrated by Docker-Compose.

## Tech Stack

| Front-End | Back-End   | Authentication | HTTP Server | Database | ORM           | Testing   | Packaging | Orchestration  |
|:---------:|:----------:|----------------|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:--------------:|
| React     | TypeScript | BCrypt.js      | Express     | MySQL    | Sequelize     | Puppeteer | Docker    | Docker-Compose |
|           | Node.js    | JWT            |             |          | Sequelize-CLI | Jest      | NPM       |                |
